<p>At The Hackerati, we have a passion for building great products, and we want to bring that passion to customers across many industries who need to bring technology products to market.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Many companies are having difficulty hiring enough talented engineers to build the sophisticated products that their markets are increasingly demanding, quickly enough to achieve time-to-market goals. Some would prefer to quickly build a minimum viable product to test the product concept in the market before committing to a larger capital investment and taking on substantial fixed costs to support a new business. In a few cases, the initial design and development capacity needed to bring a new product to market are often significantly higher than the capacity needed for ongoing operationof the product.</p>
