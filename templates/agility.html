          <h1>Agility</h1>
           <p>The Hackerati, a high-end software engineering services firm, based in New York City, delivering the innovation and engineering sophistication of large technology powerhouses, with the agility and get-it-done “hacker” culture of in-house teams. We offer variable-cost outsourcing of product development, R&D, and other custom software and hardware engineering services in areas such as social and mobile development, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Our unique business model of blending leading experts with experienced engineers and student interns allows us to deliver high-end services at a moderate price, helping businesses address the shortage of engineering talent that they currently face, helping students pay for school and graduate with a year or more of professional engineering experience, and helping academic institutions grow revenue to further their mission of preparing the next generation of engineers for the workforce.</p>

          <h2>The Problem</h2>
"The U.S. faces a projected shortfall of 230,000 qualified advanced-degree Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math workers by 2018"
- Partnership for a New American Economy
"By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions."
- McKinsey Global Institute
