<p>At The Hackerati, we are compelled to find true answers to tough questions, and not stop at the first hypothesis that sounds reasonable. We want to bring that passion to customers across many industries who need to create the next generation of whatever they do.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Many established companies risk being leapfrogged by smaller, more innovative firms. 
Some choose to innovate through acquisition, which can effectively mitigate the risks associated with R&D, but often involve paying a premium for an already-developed solution and support organization that then has to be integrated. Many that choose to innovate internally find it hard to focus existing resources on the future when so much depends on meeting short-term objectives this month and this quarter. They usually have to take on a significant capital expense and ongoing fixed cost to build and maintain an internal R&D capability.</p>
